Scripts that might be useful.

lookfor:
    Searches for strings inside files. Kind of sloppy, uses the environment to
    store its find list, but it works well if you don't ask too much from it.

fox_fix.py:
    Couldn't find a command-line utility to dress/undress windows.
    So I cobbled one together. I'm not very good at python, but
    somehow I made it work.
